# Wastebin

A pastebin written in Swift with the Kitura web development framework.

[See a live demo](http://wastebin.nocturnal.solutions/) (please let me know if it ever looks like this isn't working).

Includes [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) for client-side syntax highlighting, though I'd eventually like to do this on the server side.

## To Do

- User flagging of naughty pastes
- Self-destructing pastes that delete after 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, etc.
- Formatted (translated to HTML) Markdown view
- "Forking" pastes (create new paste with content of existing paste ready for editing)
