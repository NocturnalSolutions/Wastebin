# Wastebin

A pastebin written in Swift with the Kitura web development framework.

Still incomplete and not intended for live use.

Includes [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) for client-side syntax highlighting, though I'd eventually like to do this on the server side.

## To Do

- Auto-detection of code mode after typing/pasting and auto-selecting the appropriate mode from the menu (can be overridden by user)
- Self-destructing pastes that delete after 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, etc.
